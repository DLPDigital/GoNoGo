      How It Works: Step-by-Step Guide

        <h3 className="font-poppins text-xl mb-2">1. Create Your Event</h3>
        <p>
          Start by logging in and creating an eventâ€”whether it's a dinner party,
          a movie night, or just hanging out. Once youâ€™ve added the details, the
          event will appear in your Pending List.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li className="mt-4">
        <h3 className="font-poppins text-xl mb-2">2. Invite Your Friends</h3>
        <p>
          Send the event to your friends! When they sign up, the event will also
          appear in their Pending List.
        </p>

          3. Confirm Your Attendance
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each person can choose "Yes, I'm going", which moves the event into
          their Confirmed List.

          4. Change Your Mind? Hereâ€™s the Twist!
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you decide you donâ€™t want to go anymore, select "I don't want to go
          anymore." But hereâ€™s where it gets interesting:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-4">
          <li>
            If only you opt out, the event moves into your "You Have to Go"
            Listâ€”because plans are commitments, right? ðŸ˜‰
          </li>
          <li>
            If everyone opts out (i.e., all invitees select "I don't want to go
            anymore"), the event is officially canceled and moves into
            everyoneâ€™s Declined Events List.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          5. Stay Accountable (and Have Fun!)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The unique "You Have to Go" mechanic adds a playful layer of
          accountability to your plansâ€”because sometimes all it takes is a
          little nudge to make memories happen!
