# Event Buddy
This is a simple project designed to make it easy to arrange tentative meetings with friends.

We all agree to go to things we don't really want to but feel like we can't say no.

If you use Event Buddy to arrange, you can decline an event and your friend will not be told. If they also decline, then the event is cancelled.
